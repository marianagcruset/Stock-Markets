## Technologies Used

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python, TA and Jupyter Notebook.

### Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database I am intending to use.

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library I will be using to create a classifier. My training and testing setup is train_test_split and TA library for getting the features to be used in the model.

### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, I will also integrate Plotly.
